So far I have modified these files:
- y rod frontal idlers, Mendel 90 style plus logo.
- y motor holders front and back they are now similar and a mirror of each other.
  _Added a threaded rod  for stability.
    My observations on this holders were that when motor was spinning extrange twisting happened.
      Changes applied decresed the twisting, note no measurements taken(a ojo).
- main frames(motor and no motor) retouched to get more stability.
  _Middle are of the frame provided with a hollow hexagon as it was woobly.
  _Plataform now covering the whole area of the base, more hollow hexagons to save on material.
  _In the area were the motor was attached I added a full surface although it now makes a little harder 
    to assamble it gives more stability as it was woobly when motor was spinning.
  _Also to help minimize the twisting of the frame when the motor was spinning I added a 8mm threaded rod
    that connects left and right frame and makes the XZ axis more stable.
