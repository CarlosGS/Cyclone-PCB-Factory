Hardware for Cyclone-PCB-Factory  
===================

Version 2.0a  
--  
Adressing all the issues from the original design, implementing improvements by yOPERO, Martin Zabojnik and others.

* More robust design with tougher parts:
 * Better holders for the linear bearings (vibration makes them slide away)
 * Reinforced nut/screw holders
* Attachment for a vacuum cleaner
* Better scalability (parameterized design)
* Using a [Dremel 200](http://www.dremel.com/en-us/tools/Pages/ToolDetail.aspx?pid=200+Series) as the spindle motor
* Integrated endstop holders

Work in progress. Pending tasks:  
--  
* Improve vacuum cleaner attachment (make it detachable)
* Create protective covers for the gears
* Endstop integration for X, Y and Z
* Better plastic-saving holes for the X frames
* Improve the nut holder in the X carriage (with the same spring mechanism as in Y)
* Re-design the [Z carriage](INHERITED) after testing performance
* Re-design the [gears](INHERITED) with smoother edges
