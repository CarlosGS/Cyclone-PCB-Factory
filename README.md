Read this, it's important!
===========================
If you are reading this, then you may be looking at the **development version** of Cyclone PCB Factory.
This means files may present inconsistencies (dimensions mismatch, lack of tolerances, etc).
**If you just want to build the machine, take a look at the following locations:**

- **Releases: <https://github.com/carlosgs/Cyclone-PCB-Factory/releases>**
- **Documentation: <https://github.com/carlosgs/Cyclone-PCB-Factory/wiki>**

**Recent news:**
* [Kris Wauters](http://www.digitalplayground.be/) has designed [a set of feet](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1131591) that raise up the machine and allow to place the electronics underneath. He has also made a [Z endstop support](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1131591). Check out his beautiful build in [his blog](http://www.digitalplayground.be/?p=3255).
* Introductory tutorial: [**Milling a bowl with bCNC**](https://github.com/carlosgs/grblForCyclone/wiki/2%29-Hello-World!-Mill-a-bowl-with-bCNC) (**implemented support for GRBL firmware in RAMPS and Sanguinololu** 3D printer electronics. GRBL is better for CNCs than Marlin).
* Released [**Cyclone XL (beta)**](Output_files/Cyclone_XL) with a milling area of **500x250mm**.
* BQ additions have been re-incorporated into the main parametric design (zip-ties in the Y carriage linear bearing holders, longer Z motor gear, same orientation for the Y rod idlers).
* If you use RAMPS, you may want to try this [GRBL mod](https://github.com/carlosgs/grblForCyclone), it is better than Marlin. Control it with the [bCNC](https://github.com/vlachoudis/bCNC) graphical interface.
* Z carriage modified for Dremel 3000 by [Nicolas Arias](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/cyclone-pcb-factory/mfZC0KEy7gw/TaSLBKO9QJUJ) and [Marcos Bladauskas](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/cyclone-pcb-factory/WJLWC5qAm-w/70eSQ2DBCAAJ) ([download it here](Output_files/Zcarriages)).
* Check out the [Arduino CNC shield housing](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:929981) by Oliver Kreuzenbeck (Helicon).
* [Source code improvements (better parameterization, M4 screw version)](https://github.com/carlosgs/Cyclone-PCB-Factory/pull/33) by [Arne Durr (D-Byte)](https://github.com/D-Byte).
* An [**aluminium spindle holder**](https://github.com/carlosgs/Cyclone-PCB-Factory/pull/40) by [Marc Muntada (quikshot)](https://github.com/quikshot) ([download it here](Output_files/Zcarriages)).
* There is also [a folder](bq_additions) with the version by [Pedro de Oro](https://github.com/PedroDeOro) and [Luis Díaz](http://diwo.bq.com/author/ldiaz/) from **bq**, with some additions that simplify the assembly process (these have already been merged into the main branch).
* Daniel Evrard has [assembled Cyclone in Sketchup](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/cyclone-pcb-factory/1TpFxE7avRo/EBSx7ouy9GwJ) which can be very useful as a template.
* Thanks must also go to [ve3sjk](https://github.com/ve3sjk), [joco-nz](https://github.com/joco-nz), Aisflow, Yiannis Mandravellos, Samuel Kranz and [yOPERO](https://github.com/yOPERO) for their constructive discussions and continuous support.
* If your printer is too small to print the main frames of the machine, take a look at the [**shorter version of the frames**](Output_files/ShorterVersion) (thanks [Burt Bicksler!!](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/cyclone-pcb-factory/ue6NiWs713w/A7_4h4Ynf54J)).




**Cyclone PCB Factory V2.0 was developed in the department of innovation and robotics at [bq](http://www.bq.com/)**  
**V2.0** addressed all the issues from the original design, and implementing improvements by yOPERO, Martin Zabojnik and others:  

* More robust design with tougher parts:
 * Better holders for the linear bearings (vibration made them slide away)
 * Reinforced nut/screw holders
* Anti-backlash mechanisms
* Improved gears with smoother edges
* Protective cover for the gears
* Attachment for a vacuum cleaner
* Better scalability (parameterized design)
* Using a [Dremel 200](http://www.dremel.com/en-us/tools/Pages/ToolDetail.aspx?pid=200+Series) as the spindle motor
* Integrated endstop holders

Special thanks  
--  
- **Arne Durr (D-Byte)** finished the OpenScad assembly and made the code much more parametric.  
- Plenty of feedback from **Pedro de Oro**, **Alberto Valero**, **Alberto Mendez** (and **Obijuan**, **Pacle**, **Jesus**, **Ana**, **Santi**, **Antonio**, **Jose**... :-P) at the _department of innovation and robotics at [bq](http://www.bq.com/)_. **Cyclone is much more user-friendly thanks to you!**  
- **Glen Chung** (<https://github.com/glenchung>) improved the OpenScad code quite a lot (a much more elegant code), providing a great start point for V2.0.  
- Z axis concepts by **Quim Borras** and the spindle motor holder by **Misan** were really useful!! Also, **Diego Viejo**'s machine was of great inspiration for the Z axis (<https://plus.google.com/u/0/photos/113930344830086538817/albums/5868944432651911713?authkey=CLDJgdehlN773gE>) **Thank you all!!**  
- This design woudn't have been possible without the encouragement of the **Panda CNC community** (<https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/102402711800402614517>)  
- Also, thanks to **Juan González-Gómez (Obijuan <http://iearobotics.com>)** for naming the machine Cyclone :)

Credit for the ideas used

The origin of Cyclone took place while I (carlosgs) was inside the **Panda CNC** community (<https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/102402711800402614517>). This is from December 2012 to mid-February 2013.  
Here is the credit for the ideas that were used:  

* _Let's design a 3D-printable CNC for PCB milling, it will be named Panda:_ **Guillermo Welch** (mid-December, via Google Talk)  
* _X carriage rod distribution:_ **César Augusto Fernández Cano** claims Cyclone's X axis is a derivate of his concept: <https://plus.google.com/u/0/111421387442355054591/posts/QrfYtEuZBaj>  
* _100x160mm workspace:_ **David Martin** <https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/16122275/PandaCNC_credit/workplace_size.png>  
* _Using gears to drive the X-Y axes:_ **Guillermo Welch** <https://plus.google.com/u/0/101232926728463427403/posts/QjZGNcWcgGg>  
* _Regarding the woodbase:_ **Guillermo Welch** always contemplated the possibility of attaching the machine (optionally) to a woodbase. I decided to use the base as a main structural part instead. See <https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/16122275/PandaCNC_credit/woodbase.png> (screenshot from <https://plus.google.com/u/0/113437723819360223498/posts/8LDCSSVWqCS>)  
* _List of CNC endmill types:_ **David Martin** <https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/16122275/PandaCNC_credit/cnc_endmill_types.png>  

Please note I have taken screenshots of the post that are on the closed G+ Panda community (<https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/116318709564872967169>). You can register and see by yourself.  

**All other development present on Cyclone has nothing to do with Panda and is not related to the Panda project.**
