Read this, it's important!
===========================
If you are reading this, then you are looking at the **development version** of Cyclone PCB Factory.
This means files may present inconsistencies (dimensions mismatch, lack of tolerances, etc).
**If you just want to build the machine, take a look at the following locations:**

- **Releases: <https://github.com/carlosgs/Cyclone-PCB-Factory/releases>**
- **Documentation: <http://reprap.org/wiki/Cyclone_PCB_Factory>**

Getting the (development) source files  
========================================
Install git (http://git-scm.com/) onto your system. Then run a clone:


	git clone git://github.com/carlosgs/Cyclone-PCB-Factory.git


This will download the latest sources into a directory named 'Cyclone-PCB-Factory'.  


Version 2.1 (Unstable, Work In Progress)  
--  

**Cyclone PCB Factory V2.0 was developed in the department of innovation and robotics at [bq](http://www.bq.com/)**  

V2.0 addresses all the issues from the original design, and implementing improvements by yOPERO, Martin Zabojnik and others.  

* More robust design with tougher parts:
 * Better holders for the linear bearings (vibration made them slide away)
 * Reinforced nut/screw holders
* Anti-backlash mechanisms
* Improved gears with smoother edges
* Protective cover for the gears
* Attachment for a vacuum cleaner
* Better scalability (parametrized design)
* Using a [Dremel 200](http://www.dremel.com/en-us/tools/Pages/ToolDetail.aspx?pid=200+Series) as the spindle motor
* Integrated endstop holders

Future improvements:  
--  
* Endstop integration for Z (integrated probe?)
* Re-implement/Improve the Z carriage, currently inherited from Cyclone V1

Special thanks  
--  
- **Arne Durr (D-Byte)** finished the OpenScad assembly and made the code much more parametric.  
- Plenty of feedback from **Pedro de Oro**, **Alberto Valero**, **Alberto Mendez** (and **Obijuan**, **Pacle**, **Jesus**, **Ana**, **Santi**, **Antonio**, **Jose**... :-P) at the _department of innovation and robotics at [bq](http://www.bq.com/)_. **Cyclone is much more user-friendly thanks to you!**  
- **Glen Chung** (<https://github.com/glenchung>) improved the OpenScad code quite a lot (a much more elegant code), providing a great start point for V2.0.  
- Z axis concepts by **Quim Borras** and the spindle motor holder by **Misan** were really useful!! Also, **Diego Viejo**'s machine was of great inspiration for the Z axis (<https://plus.google.com/u/0/photos/113930344830086538817/albums/5868944432651911713?authkey=CLDJgdehlN773gE>) **Thank you all!!**  
- This design woudn't have been possible without the encouragement of the **Panda CNC community** (<https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/102402711800402614517>)  
- Also, thanks to **Juan González-Gómez (Obijuan <http://iearobotics.com>)** for naming the machine Cyclone :)

Credit for the ideas used

The origin of Cyclone took place while I (carlosgs) was inside the **Panda CNC** community (<https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/102402711800402614517>). This is from December 2012 to mid-February 2013.  
Here is the credit for the ideas that were used:  

* _Let's design a 3D-printable CNC for PCB milling, it will be named Panda:_ **Guillermo Welch** (mid-December, via Google Talk)  
* _X carriage rod distribution:_ **César Augusto Fernández Cano** claims Cyclone's X axis is a derivate of his concept: <https://plus.google.com/u/0/111421387442355054591/posts/QrfYtEuZBaj>  
* _100x160mm workspace:_ **David Martin** <https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/16122275/PandaCNC_credit/workplace_size.png>  
* _Using gears to drive the X-Y axes:_ **Guillermo Welch** <https://plus.google.com/u/0/101232926728463427403/posts/QjZGNcWcgGg>  
* _Regarding the woodbase:_ **Guillermo Welch** always contemplated the possibility of attaching the machine (optionally) to a woodbase. I decided to use the base as a main structural part instead. See <https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/16122275/PandaCNC_credit/woodbase.png> (screenshot from <https://plus.google.com/u/0/113437723819360223498/posts/8LDCSSVWqCS>)  
* _List of CNC endmill types:_ **David Martin** <https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/16122275/PandaCNC_credit/cnc_endmill_types.png>  

Please note I have taken screenshots of the post that are on the closed G+ Panda community (<https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/116318709564872967169>). You can register and see by yourself.  

**All other development present on Cyclone has nothing to do with Panda and is not related to the Panda project.**
