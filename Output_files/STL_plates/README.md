This plate can serve as a reference on how to print the parts.  
You can also open the STL with [Cura](http://wiki.ultimaker.com/Cura) and use the option "split into parts" to easily re-arrange your own plates.  
In fact, this plate was generated from [the fully assembled STL](../templates/Cyclone.stl).  

Tested Cura slicing settings:  

	Material: PLA, 1.75 mm
	Nozzle diameter: 0.4 mm
	Layer height: 0.25 mm
	Shell thickness: 1.2 mm
	Bottom/Top thickness: 1 mm
	Fill density: 20 %
	Print speed: 60 mm/s
	Printing temperature: 210 deg
