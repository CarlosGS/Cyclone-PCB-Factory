**Warning: This machine is experimental and may be too wobbly due to the large dimensions involved. Build at your own risk.**

Differences from regular version:  
- Smooth rod lengths: X=340mm Y=770mm (cut them with some additional margin).  
- Note that the Y rods (the long ones) must be M10 rather than M8, and the Y linear bearings LM10UU.  
- Milling area: ~50x25cm  

For the assembly, print templates [A](templates/Cyclone_base_template_A4.pdf) and [B](templates/Cyclone_workbed_template.pdf) to 1:1 scale in A4 paper. This will help you to accurately position the 3D printed parts into the wood bases. Check the [full template](templates/Cyclone_base_template.pdf) for better reference.
